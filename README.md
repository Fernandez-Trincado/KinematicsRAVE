[2] Simulations

In this work (Fernandez-Trincado et al. 2015b, submitted), we intestigate the reliability [...] by computing backward in time the orbits of XXX RAVE stars and XXXX in a Milky-Way-like axysimmetric Galactic potential, looking for close enconters [...].

We executed 10^5 orbits using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.
